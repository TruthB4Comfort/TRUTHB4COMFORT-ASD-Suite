Axiom 1: Information Control
Axiom Statement:
"When a public information system (e.g., government agency, major social media platform) systematically removes or algorithmically suppresses specific, discrete factual claims that are subsequently independently and conclusively verified by a consensus of distinct, non-partisan, and recognized expert institutions (e.g., peer-reviewed scientific bodies, international fact-checking networks with established methodologies), and the system's justification for such action is explicitly or implicitly 'harm' without providing demonstrable, immediate, and direct causal evidence of public danger (e.g., incitement to violence, provable physical injury resulting directly from the claim's dissemination), then the system's behavior constitutes a measurable prioritization of its own authoritative narrative over the unimpeded dissemination of verified facts."

Axiom 2: Suppression of Inquiry
Axiom Statement:When a public communication platform (e.g., social media network, public forum) imposes punitive measures (e.g., account suspension, content deletion) on users who articulate questions that are: (a) precisely formulated regarding an institution's public function or stated policy, (b) grounded in publicly available data or established scientific/logical principles, and (c) do not incorporate or promote demonstrably false factual assertions; and the platform's official response consistently fails to provide a direct, evidence-supported, and specific answer to the question's premise, instead citing 'inappropriateness,' 'disruptiveness,' or vague 'harm' without further substantiation, then this pattern of behavior signifies the platform's active reinforcement of a singular authorized narrative over open, critical inquiry."

Axiom 3: Truth Re-framing
Axiom Statement:
"When an official or dominant information ecosystem (e.g., mainstream media, government communication channels) consistently applies pejorative labels (e.g., 'conspiracy theory,' 'misinformation,' 'malicious,' 'disinformation') to specific factual information that has been independently verified as accurate by reputable, non-partisan fact-checking organizations, without simultaneously publishing a detailed, evidence-based refutation of the information's accuracy; and the visibility or accessibility of that information is observably and significantly reduced across its channels, then this multi-pronged behavior indicates a deliberate strategy of narrative shaping prioritised above the unbiased assessment of factual content."


Axiom 4: Structural Self-Preservation
Axiom Statement:
"When a defined institutional or bureaucratic system (e.g., government department, large corporation) experiences multiple, documented instances of systemic operational failure in a specific functional area (e.g., repeated project cost overruns, documented regulatory non-compliance, recurring service deficiencies), and concurrently implements or enforces policies and practices that observably restrict public or internal discourse directly pertaining to these specific failures (e.g., active suppression of internal audit reports, documented retaliation against employees who reveal these failures, deletion or redaction of public records detailing the patterns), then this combined pattern of action and suppression serves as evidence of an active organizational strategy to shield inherent structural vulnerabilities from scrutiny and accountability."
